# Mathing 🎲🔢

This repository contains some of my research projects and scripts that I work on just for fun. The initial focus here is **cousin primes**, but I’m fascinated by prime constellations in general..

### Asymptotic Density of Cousin Primes
One project I'm diving into is looking at the **asymptotic density of cousin primes**. Cousin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 4 (for example, 3 and 7). I recently wrote a Python script that plots how the density of these primes changes as we go higher and higher in the prime number sequence.

Here's a quick visual of the **asymptotic density of cousin primes** up to 1000:

## How to Use the Scripts
Clone this repo and check out the Python scripts. You’ll need `sympy` and `matplotlib` to run most of them. Here’s how to set it up:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mathing.git
cd mathing
pip install -r requirements.txt
