This repository contains some of my research projects and scripts that I work on just for fun. The initial focus here is cousin primes, but Iâ€™m fascinated by prime constellations in general.


(Here)[https://medium.com/@laurelweber/the-hardy-littlewood-conjectures-exploring-the-asymptotic-densities-of-prime-pairs-c1570cb984d1] is a link to a Medium article I wrote on the Hardy-Littlewood Conjectures. It showcases some of the visualizations created in this repository.

### Asymptotic Density of Cousin Primes
One project I'm diving into is looking at the asymptotic density of cousin primes. Cousin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 4 (for example, 3 and 7). I recently wrote a Python script that plots how the density of these primes changes as we go higher and higher in the prime number sequence.

Here's a quick visual of the asymptotic density of cousin primes up to 1000:

![{C8B5B4AD-0F27-4F18-A6EC-723BA89B063A}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b16a8f7-b607-4e22-bd8e-10796bc06795)

Note that the asymptotic density of the cousin primes is expected to be the same as that of the twin primes, according to the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture.

## How to Use the Scripts
Clone this repo and check out the Python scripts. Youâ€™ll need `sympy` and `matplotlib` to run most of them. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mathing.git
cd mathing
pip install -r requirements.txt
